# Facilities_ML_Project
Create a simple Facilities Operations example of applying machine learning to predict if Work Orders are likely to be completed on time.

## Facilities Operations: Predict Past Due Work with Machine Learning 

- Demonstrate the process of taking historical data and creating a machine learning model to both predict and explain future work being on time or not. 
- View ipynb [here](https://github.com/coryroyce/Explainable_AI/blob/main/Notebooks/SHAP_Values_for_Multi_Output_Regression_Models.ipynb) (Recommend running the entire notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb))
