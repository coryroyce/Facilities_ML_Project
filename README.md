# Facilities_ML_Project

Create a simple Facilities Operations example of applying machine learning to predict if Work Orders are likely to be completed on time.

## Facilities Operations: Predict Past Due Work with Machine Learning

- Demonstrate the process of taking historical data and creating a machine learning model to both predict and explain future work being on time or not.

Use historical facilities work data to cerate a machine learning model to predict past due work. Then review the model metrics and generate detailed explanations with SHAP.
